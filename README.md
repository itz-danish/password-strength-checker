cd password-strength-checker
```

### No Additional Dependencies
This project uses only Python's built-in libraries, so no pip installation is required!

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
python password_checker_gui.py
```

### Using the Password Checker

1. **Enter a password** in the input field
2. **View real-time analysis**:
   - Strength level and score
   - Progress bar visualization
   - Criteria checklist with visual indicators
3. **Read improvement suggestions** in the feedback area

### Password Strength Levels

| Level | Score | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Very Weak | 0-2 | Red | Easily crackable, needs major improvements |
| Weak | 3-4 | Red-Orange | Below security standards |
| Moderate | 5-6 | Orange | Acceptable but could be stronger |
| Strong | 7-8 | Light Green | Good security level |
| Very Strong | 9-10 | Green | Excellent security, meets all criteria |

## Security Criteria Explained

### Length Requirements
- **Minimum**: 6 characters (1 point)
- **Good**: 8 characters (2 points)
- **Excellent**: 12+ characters (3 points)

### Character Variety (1 point each)
- **Lowercase letters**: a, b, c, ..., z
- **Uppercase letters**: A, B, C, ..., Z
- **Numbers**: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
- **Special characters**: !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>

### Pattern Detection
The tool detects and penalizes common weak patterns:
- Sequential numbers (123456, 789, etc.)
- Sequential letters (abcdef, xyz, etc.)
- Common passwords (password, qwerty, admin)
- Repeated characters (aaa, 111, etc.)

### Character Type Variety Bonus
- **4 different types**: +2 points
- **3 different types**: +1 point
